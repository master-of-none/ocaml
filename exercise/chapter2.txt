1) What is the type and value of each of the following OCaml expressions? 
  a) 7 * (1 + 2 + 3)
  Answer: int

  b) "CS " ^ string_of_int 3110
  Answer: string

2) Operators
  a) Write an expression that multiplies 42 by 10.
  Answer: 42 * 10;;

  b) Write an expression that divides 3.14 by 2.0. Hint: integer and floating-point operators are written differently in OCaml.
  Answer: 3.14 /. 2.0;;

  c) Write an expression that computes 4.2 raised to the seventh power.
  Answer: 4.2 ** 7.

3) Equality
  a) Write an expression that compares 42 to 42 using structural equality.
  Answer: 42 = 42

  b) Write an expression that compares "hi" to "hi" using structural equality. What is the result?
  Answer: "hi" = "hi", gives true

  c) Write an expression that compares "hi" to "hi" using physical equality. What is the result?
  Answer: "hi"== "hi", gives false

4) Assert
  a) Enter assert true;; into utop and see what happens.
  Answer: Gives unit

  b) Enter assert false;; into utop and see what happens.
  Answer: Gives exception

  c) Write an expression that asserts 2110 is not (structurally) equal to 3110.
  Answer: 
  assert (2110 <> 3110);;
  assert (not (2110 = 3110));;

5) if
  a) Write an if expression that evaluates to 42 if 2 is greater than 1 and otherwise evaluates to 7.
  Answer: if 2 > 1 then 42 else 7;;

6) double fun
  a) Using the increment function from above as a guide, define a function double that multiplies its input by 2. For example, double 7 would be 14. Test your function by applying it to a few inputs.

  Answer: let double n = n * 2;;

7) more fun
  a) Define a function that computes the cube of a floating-point number. Test your function by applying it to a few
inputs.
  Answer: let cube x = x ** 3.;;

  b) Define a function that computes the sign (1, 0, or -1) of an integer. Use a nested if expression. Test your function
by applying it to a few inputs.
  Answer: let compute x = if x < 0 then -1 else if x > 0 then 1 else 0;;

  c) Define a function that computes the area of a circle given its radius.
  Answer: let area x = 3.1412 *. x ** 2.;;

8) RMS
  a)Define a function that computes the root mean square of two numbers‚Äîi.e., ‚àö(ùë•2 + ùë¶2)/2. Test your function with
assert.
  Answer: let rms x y = sqrt((x ** 2. +. y ** 2.) /. 2.);;
