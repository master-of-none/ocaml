1) list expressions
  a) Construct a list that has the integers 1 through 5 in it. Use the square bracket notation for lists.
  Answer:
  let lst1 = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5];;

  b) Construct the same list, but do not use the square bracket notation. Instead use :: and [].
  Answer:
  let lst1 = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: 5 :: [];;
  
  c) Construct the same list again. This time, the following expression must appear in your answer: [2; 3; 4]. Use
the @ operator, and do not use ::.
  Answer:
  let lst1 = [1] @ [2; 3; 4] @ [5];;

2) Product of list
Answer:
let rec prod = function
| [] -> 1
| h :: t -> h * prod t

3) Concatenation of List
Answer:
let rec concat_list = function
| [] -> ""
| h :: t -> h ^ concat_list t
